Shoot'em Ducks is a first-person duck shooting game with a distinctive low-poly aesthetic. Designed as a personal project, it showcases my ability to develop engaging gameplay mechanics, implement UI elements, and optimize visual clarity while maintaining stylistic appeal.

## Features

- **Low-Poly Art Style** – A minimalist yet visually distinct design that enhances clarity and immersion.
- **First-Person Perspective** – Unrestricted aiming with deliberate movement constraints to focus on shooting mechanics.
- **Game Environments** – Includes a main menu and in-game environments consistent with the low-poly aesthetic.
- **HUD & UI** – Under active development to ensure intuitive player interaction and engagement.

## Controls

| Action          | Key/Button       |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Look Around     | `Mouse Movement` |
| Shoot           | `Left Mouse`     |
| Aim             | `Right Mouse`    |
| Reload          | `R`              |
