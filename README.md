Shoot'em Ducks is a first-person duck shooting game with a distinctive low-poly aesthetic. Designed as a personal project, it showcases my ability to develop engaging gameplay mechanics, implement UI elements, and optimize visual clarity while maintaining stylistic appeal.

## Features

- **Low-Poly Art Style** – A minimalist yet visually distinct design that enhances clarity and immersion.
- **First-Person Perspective** – Unrestricted aiming with deliberate movement constraints to focus on shooting mechanics.
- **Game Environments** – Includes a main menu and in-game environments consistent with the low-poly aesthetic.
- **HUD & UI** – Under active development to ensure intuitive player interaction and engagement.

## Controls

| Action          | Key/Button       |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Look Around     | `Mouse Movement` |
| Shoot           | `Left Mouse`     |
| Reload          | `R`              |

*(Note: Shooting mechanics and related functionalities are in progress.)*

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lukeslater0961/shoot-em-ducks.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity (version 6.0.0 or later).
3. Run the game within the Unity Editor or build it for Windows, Mac, or Linux.

## Development Roadmap

### Completed:
- Main menu and in-game environment design
- Crosshair implementation
- Shooting mechanics
- Scoring system

### In Progress:
-UI to set game modes / difficulty etc

### Planned:
- pregame menu
    - ammo system (limited bullets(UI) set in menu, basically difficulty, reload button)
    - infinity mode (no wave just infinite ammo + targets with maybe a set amount of lives or not and an increasing speed)
- wave system
    - set amount of targets and then maybe some special targets for extra points
    - wave is validated with minimum amount score required ?
- target types (scriptable objects for set materials , health and points)
- Change main menu decor (remove tables ? or just the tags for the interact and add the canon somewhere )
