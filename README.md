# Low-Poly Shooter Game

Welcome to the **Shoot'em Ducks** repository. This project represents an ongoing effort to develop an engaging and visually distinct first-person duck shooting experience within a low-poly aesthetic framework. Initiated as a personal endeavor, this project is currently in its early stages of development.

---

## Features

- **Low-Poly Art Style**: Employs a minimalist design ethos to enhance visual clarity while maintaining stylistic appeal.
- **First-Person Perspective**: Allows unrestricted aiming and visual exploration, with player mobility intentionally constrained to heighten focus on shooting mechanics.
- **Environments**: Includes main menu and game menu environments, designed to reflect the low-poly aesthetic.
- **HUD**: HUD visuals are under active development to enhance user interaction and immersion.
